# Extra ⭐ (I will add more stuff here)

## Installing apps with Veteris

You want to install apps right? Well, it's kinda impossible now because of the App Store changes 

Open cydia and add this repo `http://yzu.moe/dev/` and install veteris from the `utility` sub-folder

To make it work You will need AppSyncUnified from `https://cydia.akemi.ai`

## Fixing YouTube

"Aww man, i wish i could watch YouTube on my iPhone 5 like old times"

You now can with TubeRepair by bag.xml, she made this majestic tweak!

Add bag.xml's repo: `http://cydia.bag-xml.com/`

After you added the repo and installed the tweak type a link for an active instance in the settings (in the settings app scroll down until you find `TubeRepair`, now click on it and paste/write a URL for an active instance), my personal favorite is `https://tuberepair.uptimetrackers.com/`

I reccomend You to use Youtube 1.2.1 (you can install it from Veteris)

## Fixing system apps

You will need the repo that i mentioned in the `Installing apps with Veteris` step

After you added that repo add to the queue `StocksX` and `WeatherX` and, from another repo (`cydia.skyglow.es`) `MapsX` after that install all of them and you should be good to go!
