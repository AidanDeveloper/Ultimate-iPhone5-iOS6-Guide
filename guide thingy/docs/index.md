# The ultimate iPhone 5 jailbreak guide
I love the iPhone 5, it's one of my favorite iPhones ever made... But what if we make it **better** and *faster*?

### Jailbreaking iOS 
Jailbreaking legacy versions of iOS is so easy, what you need is:

Your iPhone 5 running iOS 6 to 10.3.4

Your computer/laptop 

Lighting cable

**When You have everything you need go to:** `https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started/iPhone-5.html` **on Your computer/laptop and read the guide**


### Installing required certificates
Cydia needs some certificates to make it working, without them it will not load.

What you need to do is just go to safari and put this link in the bar `tlsroot.litten.ca`.

After that you need to click on "Signed iOS Bundle (iOS 5+)" and install them!


### CoolBooter (optional if you already use iOS 6)
[CoolBooter](https://coolbooter.com/) allows us to dual-boot 2 versions of iOS. 
In this guide we will use iOS 6 because it is the *faster* version of iOS that can run on your iPhone 5
After you installed the certificates from `step 2` open cydia and add this repo `https://coolbooter.com` (If you don't know how to add a repo, [read this short tutorial.](https://ios.cfw.guide/it_IT/using-cydia/)) and download and install CoolBooter.

Now that You are in the CoolBooter app, tap on `install` and scroll until You select iOS 6.1.4, now select the amount of space you want to allocate for the iOS 6 partition by tapping on `storage`, now tap on `i'm ready` and follow all of the commands on screen, I reccomend you to choose to jailbreak your new iOS 6 installation because no other software than CoolCooter can jailbreak your iOS 6 partition, after CoolBooter completed It's job, reboot Your device when promted.

After you rebooted your iPhone 5 open CoolBooter again and click on `boot` and lock your device when promted.

Now set up iOS 6, when it tells you to sign into your Apple ID (now Apple Account) tap on `skip` because we will do it *later* with iFile by deleteng a few files and folders.

Now you should be inside of iOS 6 without any problem!
