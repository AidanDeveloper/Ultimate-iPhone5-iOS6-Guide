Go to extras ) I love the iPhone 5, it's one of my favorite iPhones ever made... But what if we make it better and faster ? Jailbreaking and downgrading iOS using Legacy iOS Kit (Optional if you already use iOS 6, 7, 8 or 9) Jailbreak iOS 10 using this guide Before you do anything, you will need to downgrade your iPhone 5 to iOS 8.4.1, because iOS 10 doesn't work with CoolBooter unless you install CoolBooter fix for Socket but i don't reccomend using it because it could be unstable For downgrading to iOS 8.4.1 you will need to follow this guide in the A6(X) devices, jailbroken on iOS 10 section Installing required certificates Cydia needs some certificates to make it working, without them it will not load. What you need to do is just go to safari and put this link in the bar tlsroot.litten.ca . After that you need to click on `Unsigned iOS Bundle\" and install them! Installing CoolBooter CoolBooter allows you to dual-boot 2 versions of iOS. In this guide we will use iOS 6 because it is the faster version of iOS that can run on your iPhone 5 After you installed the certificates from step 2 open cydia and add this repo https://coolbooter.com (If you don't know how to add a repo, read this short tutorial. ) and download and install CoolBooter. Now that you are in the CoolBooter app, tap on install and scroll until you select iOS 6.1.4 or 6.0 , now select the amount of space you want to allocate for the iOS 6 partition by tapping on storage , now tap on i'm ready and follow all of the commands on screen, I reccomend you to choose to jailbreak your new iOS 6 installation because no other software than CoolCooter can jailbreak your iOS 6 partition, after CoolBooter completed It's job, reboot Your device when promted. After you rebooted your iPhone 5 open CoolBooter again and click on boot and lock your device when promted. Now set up iOS 6, when it tells you to sign into your Apple ID (now Apple Account) tap on skip because we will do it later with iFile by deleteng a few files and folders. Now you should be inside of iOS 6 without any problem! Now you just need to repeat Installing required certificates","title":"Home"},{"location":"#the-ultimate-iphone-5-jailbreak-guide-this-section-is-useless-if-you-already-use-ios-6-go-to-extras","text":"I love the iPhone 5, it's one of my favorite iPhones ever made...
