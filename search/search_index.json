But what if we make it better and faster ? Jailbreaking iOS Jailbreaking legacy versions of iOS is so easy, what you need is: Your iPhone 5 running iOS 6 to 10.3.4 Your computer/laptop Lighting cable When You have everything you need go to: https://ios.cfw.guide/get-started/iPhone-5.html on Your computer/laptop and read the guide Installing required certificates Cydia needs some certificates to make it working, without them it will not load. What you need to do is just go to safari and put this link in the bar tlsroot.litten.ca . After that you need to click on \"Signed iOS Bundle (iOS 5+)\" and install them! CoolBooter (optional if you already use iOS 6) CoolBooter allows us to dual-boot 2 versions of iOS. In this guide we will use iOS 6 because it is the faster version of iOS that can run on your iPhone 5 After you installed the certificates from step 2 open cydia and add this repo https://coolbooter.com (If you don't know how to add a repo, read this short tutorial. ) and download and install CoolBooter. Now that You are in the CoolBooter app, tap on install and scroll until You select iOS 6.1.4, now select the amount of space you want to allocate for the iOS 6 partition by tapping on storage , now tap on i'm ready and follow all of the commands on screen, I reccomend you to choose to jailbreak your new iOS 6 installation because no other software than CoolCooter can jailbreak your iOS 6 partition, after CoolBooter completed It's job, reboot Your device when promted. After you rebooted your iPhone 5 open CoolBooter again and click on boot and lock your device when promted. Now set up iOS 6, when it tells you to sign into your Apple ID (now Apple Account) tap on skip because we will do it later with iFile by deleteng a few files and folders. Now you should be inside of iOS 6 without any problem!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#the-ultimate-iphone-5-jailbreak-guide","text":"I love the iPhone 5, it's one of my favorite iPhones ever made...
